                Hey there, I'm Hossain Ahmedâ€”a passionate full-stack web
                developer deeply engaged in the MERN stack. My proficiency spans
                Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Tailwind
                CSS, as evidenced by the diverse range of projects I've

                My venture into the realm of web development commenced in June
                2022, marking the inception of an exciting and transformative
                journey. From the outset, my passion for JavaScript has been a
                driving force, compelling me to delve into its nuances with
                unbridled enthusiasm. Eager to broaden my understanding and
                proficiency, I consistently engage in immersive learning
                experiences, exploring the multifaceted aspects of this
                versatile programming language. This dynamic pursuit not only
                fuels my knowledge but also propels me to stay abreast of the
                ever-evolving landscape of web development.

                In a nutshell, I'm a motivated web developer who's always

                have a solid background in MERN stack development, love working
                with JavaScript, and am committed to delivering top-notch
